Flutter plugin for [Facebook App Events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events).

> An app event is an action that takes place in your app or on your web page such as a person installing your app or completing a purchase. Facebook App Events allows you to track these events to measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting.

Flutter plugin for Facebook App Events, an app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.

## Setting things up

You must first create an app at Facebook for developers: https://developers.facebook.com/

Get your app id (referred to as `[APP_ID]` below)

### Configure Android

Read through the "[Getting Started with App Events for Android](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-android)" tutuorial and in particular, follow [step 2](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-android#2--add-your-facebook-app-id) by adding the following into `/app/res/values/strings.xml` (or into respective `debug` or `release` build flavor)

```xml
<string name="facebook_app_id">[APP_ID]</string>
```

After that, add that string resource reference to your main `AndroidManifest.xml` file, directly under the `<application>` tag.

```xml
<meta-data
  android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId"
  android:value="@string/facebook_app_id" />
```

### Configure iOS

Read through the "[Getting Started with App Events for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-ios)" tutuorial and in particular, follow [step 4](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-ios#plist-config) by opening `info.plist` "As Source Code" and add the following

- If your code does not have `CFBundleURLTypes`, add the following just before the final `</dict>` element:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
  <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
  <array>
    <string>fb[APP_ID]</string>
  </array>
  </dict>
</array>
<key>FacebookAppID</key>
<string>[APP_ID]</string>
<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
<string>[APP_NAME]</string>
```

- If your code already contains `CFBundleURLTypes`, insert the following:

```xml
<array>
 <dict>
 <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
 <array>
   <string>fb[APP_ID]</string>
 </array>
 </dict>
</array>
<key>FacebookAppID</key>
<string>[APP_ID]</string>
<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
<string>[APP_NAME]</string>
```
